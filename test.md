Every week, to achieve progressive overload:

1. Increase the resistance of the band if possible.
2. Increase the repetitions (up to 15-20), after which you can increase the resistance.

Remember, always warm up before your workouts and cool down afterwards. Staying hydrated, getting proper rest, and maintaining a balanced diet will help in weight loss and muscle recovery.
