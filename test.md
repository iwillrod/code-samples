* **Progressive Overload:** Every week, increase the resistance of the bands if available, increase reps, or both to ensure progress. For exercises like the band-assisted pull-ups, decrease band assistance to increase difficulty.
* **Warm-Up:** It's a good idea to start each session with a 5-minute warm-up. This can be a brisk walk, marching in place, or gentle dynamic stretches.
* **Rest Period:** Keep rest periods between 30-60 seconds between sets to keep workouts under 30 minutes.
* **Cool Down:** End each session with a 5-minute cool down of deep breathing and stretching.

I've tried to keep the workouts varied to target different muscle groups and keep the routine engaging. Remember, it's essential to pay attention to how your body feels and progress at your own pace.
